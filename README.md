# "Automated Deployment of Medusa Headless Commerce Backend on AWS ECS with Terraform and GitHub Actions"
This project aims to deploy the open-source Medusa commerce backend on AWS ECS with Fargate, leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform. The pipeline integrates GitHub Actions for continuous deployment, ensuring seamless updates to the commerce backend.

Awesome project idea! Here's a breakdown of what you'll need, and I’ll help you create everything step-by-step:

## 🛠️ How to Deploy

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akhand6886/IaC-Terraform-Aws-ECS-Fargate-for-Medusa-open-source-headless-commerce-platform-backend.git
cd IaC-Terraform-Aws-ECS-Fargate-for-Medusa-open-source-headless-commerce-platform-backend
```

2. **Build and Push Docker Image to ECR**
   - Modify the `Dockerfile` if needed
   - Use GitHub Actions or manually push

3. **Configure Terraform Variables**
   - Set up your AWS credentials and values in `terraform.tfvars` or via environment variables.

4. **Apply Terraform**
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - The GitHub Actions pipeline automatically builds, pushes the image to ECR, and deploys it to ECS on every push to `main`.

Would you like help with:

- The actual Terraform files for ECS, ECR, etc.?
- GitHub Actions pipeline YAML?
- Dockerfile for Medusa backend?

Also, once your video is ready, drop the link and I’ll update the README for you. Want me to scaffold the Terraform and CI code now?
